- User can enter the device information which are
- (Battery Power, Has Bluetooth or not, Clock Speed, Has dual sim support or not, Front Camera megapixels, Has 4G or not, Internal Memory in Gigabytes, Mobile Depth in cm, Weight of mobile phone, Number of cores of the processor, Primary Camera megapixels, Pixel Resolution Height, Pixel Resolution Width, RAM, Screen Height of mobile in cm, Screen Width of mobile in cm, Longest time that a single battery charge will last, Has 3G or not, Has touch screen or not, Has wifi or not)
- and it return the device price range 

## Machine Learning Model 

- I have trained several model to get the best result, and they are Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine
- SVM gives the best accuracy
- Test Accuracy:  96.25
- Train Accuracy:  96.31019387116947
